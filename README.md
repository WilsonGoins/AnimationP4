Project 4 - Animation - Group 8

Group Members: Michelle Yao, Samir Saldanha, Wilson Goins

Story: Astronaut hops out of the portal and finds themselves in a glowing forest. They take a look around and feel the plants on the ground. A floating creature floats into them. They walks around the environment and it starts to rain at one point. They eventually finds the crystal hidden as they takes shelter from the rain. They then hits a button on his suit and hops through the portal.

Physics/Fields/Particles: We plan to use wind in our forest to show rustling of the trees and shrubbery. We also want to have glowing rain fall in the forest for part of our animation. We also envision the small glowing creatrures to be floating around in the air in our animation.
